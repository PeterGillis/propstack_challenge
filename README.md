# README

Sci-Fi-API is a rudimentary Rails API proof of concept that can be queried with a browser or a tool like Postman.

It has simple create show and index actions for three entities:

* Spaceships
* Missions
* CrewMembers

You can view created records in the browser and create them in postman (or just look at the seed data)

## Running the API:
Clone the app in the normal way to your local machine and you can create a Spaceship with a post action and see a list via the index or an individual record via the show action.

* Ruby version 2.6.5

* Rails version 6.0.4.4

* System dependencies

* Configuration basic API with RSpec

* Database creation `rake db:create`

* Database initialization  `rails db:migrate` run `rails db:seed` to load basic seed if needed.

* How to run the test suite `rspec` will work nicely.
